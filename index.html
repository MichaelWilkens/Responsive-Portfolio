                <p>I am a lifelong learner. Throughout my life I have taught myself how to play guitar and drums, lived in foreign countries and learned the culture and language, learned how to take apart, fix and reassemble bicycles, and I do my own maintenance on my Volkswagen Golf. I like diving into things that I am unfamiliar with.</p>
                <p> As a teacher for the past five years, I have taught high school classes that I had to learn myself including AP US History, AP Statistics, Chemistry and Forensics. My comfort area of teaching is in Biology and Algebra, which I have enjoyed teaching in Brooklyn and here in Los Angeles where I currently live. Teaching has taught me how to learn; if you cannot teach something in a simple way, then you do not really know it.</p>
                <p>Having taught for five years, I am now excited and fully invested in mastering web development and moving into software engineering full time. I have a solid grasp of the basic three web languages, including frameworks, templating languages and servers. I know that I can master the web and computer science with enough practice, which is why I am enrolled in the UCLA coding bootcamp.  I hope to network as much as possible throughout the next six months and work with a determined and goal-oriented team in the near future.</p>
